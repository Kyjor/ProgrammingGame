Added a list of tools to the inventoryUI and kept the hotbar tools to default tools 
that everyone will have anyways. New tools can be created and added to either hotbar 
tools or the inventory tools Scriptable objects under SO/Tools/ToolsContainer if ever 
curious. These are added dynamically and do not need any changes inside the UI itself. 
Created a ToolsButtonCreation.cs script that creates  the buttons and adds a listener to 
change the tool when clicked. Also Created ToolsContainer scriptable objects to container 
different tools that can be used for different things. current there is one for the hotbar 
and one for the inventory.
